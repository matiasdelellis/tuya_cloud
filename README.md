## Notes ðŸ¤”
1. This application is enough for my current needs.
2. I am using an old API, which is not documented, and is only maintained for compatibility for older versions of Home Assistant.
3. That being said, there may be limitations that will probably force me to update the API, however I still don't expect to make that effort.
4. Beyond that, I chose this API because despite the advantages of the new API, I do not agree with its implementation. I think it is better for each person to use their credentials
